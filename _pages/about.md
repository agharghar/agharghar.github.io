Hey, I’m Zack. I’m a penetration tester, and I created this blog to share my thoughts, experiences, and notes from my work in CyberSecurity.I wanted a place to express what I’m learning and working on. Whether it’s tips on pentesting or just some ideas I want to share, this blog is where I keep track of everything. Thanks for stopping by!
